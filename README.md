# Javascript-101-projects-practicesets
 Hey folks! This is a JS repository which i made whilst i was learning the language. I will add mini projects and different practice sets (maybe). Will also learn how to maintain a repo, a meaningful commit with a message, better readme files etc. Do checkout each and every one of them if you wanna master the language.
